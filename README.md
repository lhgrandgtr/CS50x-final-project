#### Description:

     This a web aplication that helps you to find people who do day-to-day labour such as cleaning yards/houses or fixing pipes or fixing roofs etc. the bussiness concept is similar to fiver but for day-to-day labour work. Basic function is to help you contact the workers easire and quiker. To that end I think I succeeded. I used four catogories of work to divid the types of work.

     To build the web app I used django framework as it was the most popular framework used in web development at the time. I had to build a user(The person who uses the app to find workers) register system to protect employee( The person who do the day-to-day work) data. Then I later found out that django already has a user registration system in place and it can be used in the app. I lost the database control I would have if I had built the system manually but then again I just wanted to protect employee data and django system served that purpose. Also this way I didn't have to reinvent the wheel so it saved me a large amount of time.
     
     Though to register employees, I had to make a manual database and save those data with a manual system. In the employee form, the process of submiting an image for the userimage was somewhat complicated as I had to modify the django settings but I successfully managed that. I used boolean fields to store data about the kind of work they do and used conditions to filter them to their respective web pages.

     As for the front-end designs, I didn't forcus on them much as what I wanted was a reliably automated web appliacation. I put much of my attention to the back-end. So the designs won't be aesthitacally pleasing as much.
     
     Learning django was also made easy by the cs50's web development course and django guide. The process it took to get to this step is long and painfull one but totally worth it and I am thankfull to CS50 for giving me the opputunity.
