#### Description:

     This a web aplication that helps you to find people who do day-to-day labour such as cleaning yards/houses or fixing pipes 
or fixing roofs etc. Basic function is to help you contact the workers easire and quiker. To that end I think I succeeded. I used four catogories of work to dived the type of work.

     To build the web app I used django frame work as it was the most popular framework used in web development at the time. I had to build a user(The person who uses the app to find workers) register system to protect employee( The person who do the day-to-day work) data. Then I later found out that django already has a user registration system in place and it can be used in the app. I lost the database control I would have if I had built the system manually but then again I just wanted to save employee data and django system served that purpose and this way I didn't have to reinvent the wheel so it saved me large amount of time.
     
     To register employees though, I had to make a manual database and save those data with a manual system. In the employee form, the process of submiting an image for the userimage was somewhat complicated as I had to modify the django settings but I successfully managed that.
     
     Learning django was also made easy by the cs50's web development course and django guide. The process it took to get to this step is long and painfull one but totally worth it and I am thankfull to CS50 for giving me the opputunity.
